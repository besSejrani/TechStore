# Performance

## Debouncing Logic

What makes React great, is that it implements the concepts of the shadow DOM and the DOM well together.

State in React is updated in the shadow Dom before updating the real DOM, in other words, rendering the DOM is costly,

Input events and scroll events for example have tendancies to be fired after each change, to save performance, they should be minimized. By using the setTimeout function in the useEffect hook, events are updated only after 50 milliseconds.

Between events, if they are still firing, the timer will reset and wait for another 50 milliseconds. The wait time is not cumulative.

=== "React useEffect"

```Javascript

useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setTimeout(() => {
        logic
    }, 50);

    return () => {
        clearTimeout(timer);
    };
}, [state]);

```

## Code Splitting

By default, Next.js comes with code splitting. This means that the Javascript code on the login page will only be fetched, when and only the user navigates to the login page.

<hr/>

## Image Lazy Loading

The same idea as code splitting refers to image lazy loading. Instead of fetching all the assets before the user needs them, Nextjs fetches with the help of the Image module, only images that are needed on the page.

Note that the image lazy loading process can also be handled in plain Javascript with the help of the Intersection Observer API.

An example can be found on one of my other projects[^1].

=== "Next.js"

    ``` javascript
    import Image from "next/image"

    <Image
        width={300}
        height={250}
        className={"css class"}
        onClick={() => "event"}
        src={"imageUrl"}
        title={"title"}
    />
    ```

=== "Vanilla Javascript"

    ``` javascript

    const targets = document.querySelectorAll("[data-lazy]");

    const lazyLoad = (target) => {
    const io = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {
        entries.forEach((entry) => {
        if (entry.isIntersecting) {
            const img = entry.target;
            const srcset = img.getAttribute("data-lazy");
            img.setAttribute("srcset", srcset);
            observer.disconnect();
        }
        });
    });

    io.observe(target);
    };

    targets.forEach(lazyLoad);

    ```

## WebP Support

WebP is an efficient image coding format, it performs on average 30% better than JPEG or PNG for images size. The choice was clear, use only WebP.

WebP as a 89% market share, but on some web browsers it's still new, like for example Firefox on Android, it supports WebP only since January 26.

There is a way to show JPEG/PNG images to users who haven't yet updated their web browsers and WebP images to those who have updated their software, it will involve the Intersection Observer API, but this is a solution for another time.
